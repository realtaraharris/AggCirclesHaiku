General Polygon Clipper (GPC) License

Anti-Grain Geometry distribution package includes General Polygon Clipper (GPC)
by Alan Murta. GPC has a different kind of license that allows you to use Alan's
work for free only in non-commercial software. Below is the full text of it.

Author:    Alan Murta (email: gpc@cs.man.ac.uk)
Version:   2.31
Date:      4th June 1999

           This software is free for non-commercial use. It may be copied,
           modified, and redistributed provided that this copyright notice
           is preserved on all copies. The intellectual property rights of
           the algorithms used reside with the University of Manchester

           You may not use this software, in whole or in part, in support
           of any commercial product without the express consent of the
           author.

           There is no warranty or other guarantee of fitness of this
           software for any purpose. It is provided solely as-is.

However GPC is not an obligatory part of AGG and can be easily removed. You just
don't copy (or remove) agg2/gpc/* and you can also remove
agg2/include/agg_conv_gpc.h in case if the GPC license does not allow you to use
it.

GPC is a General Polygon Clipper that performs boolean operations on polygons
(poly-polygons to be exact). In AGG you can get the same visual result using
Scanline Boolean Algebra. It operates with scanline shapes and in average works
5-10 times faster than GPC. See:
Demo scanline_boolean.cpp
Demo scanline_boolean2.cpp

You need GPC if you really really want to have vector data in the ouput. For
screen graphics of any kind, Scanline Boolean Algebra is quite a good
replacement.
